This is an old Java program I wrote to separate VAGWAD.ENG into component sound files for Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy. It doesn't include the file names but could be improved to include these from VAGDIR.AYB.

To operate it put a copy of VAGWAD.ENG in a folder with the compiled jar and run it :)
